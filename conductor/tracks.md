## [x] Track: Frame Numbering Bug Fix (v5.2.4)
*Context: Fix triple root cause bug - frame numbers didn't match Wireshark (parser counted only IP packets, CLI passed wrong counter, handshake analyzer recorded last SYN-ACK)*
*Link: [./conductor/archive/tracks/frame_numbering_bug_v524/](./conductor/archive/tracks/frame_numbering_bug_v524/)*
*Version: v5.2.4 (PATCH)*
*Priority: CRITICAL 🔴*
*Status: ✅ COMPLETED*

## [x] Track: SYN Retransmission Packet Timeline Bug Fix
*Context: Fix critical data integrity bug where packet timeline shows frames from wrong TCP streams*
*Link: [./conductor/archive/tracks/syn_retrans_packet_timeline_bug/](./conductor/archive/tracks/syn_retrans_packet_timeline_bug/)*
*Version: v5.2.3 (PATCH)*
*Priority: CRITICAL 🔴*
*Status: ✅ COMPLETED*

## [ ] Track: Fix Retransmission Detection Over-Sensitivity
*Context: PCAP Analyzer detects 59% more retransmissions than tshark due to over-sensitive hybrid dpkt+Scapy algorithm - false positives, wrong Fast/RTO classification, missing spurious detection*
*Link: [./conductor/tracks/retransmission_detection_fix_v530/](./conductor/tracks/retransmission_detection_fix_v530/)*
*Version: v5.3.0 (MINOR)*
*Priority: HIGH 🟠*
*Impact: Data Accuracy & User Trust*
*Baseline: c1.pcap - PCAP Analyzer: 43 retrans, tshark: 27 retrans (59% discrepancy)*
*Target: <5% discrepancy with tshark, RFC 793 compliance, spurious detection*

## [ ] Track: Production VPS Deployment with HTTPS
*Context: Deploy to production VPS with Let's Encrypt automated TLS (pending infrastructure)*
*Link: [./conductor/tracks/vps_deployment_https/](./conductor/tracks/vps_deployment_https/)*

## [ ] Track: Modern Toast Notification System
*Context: Implement modern toast notifications to replace generic JavaScript alerts*
*Link: [./conductor/tracks/modern_toast_notification_system/](./conductor/tracks/modern_toast_notification_system/)*
*Version: v5.3.0 (MINOR)*

## [x] Track: Version Synchronization & v5.0.0-rc2 Release

## [x] Track: Let's Encrypt with cert-manager on Kubernetes
*Link: [./conductor/archive/tracks/letsencrypt_certmanager/](./conductor/archive/tracks/letsencrypt_certmanager/)*

## [x] Assistant Work: v4.28.2 & v4.28.3 - Documentation Email + Production Domain + Fix Dépendances 2FA
*Date: 2025-12-26*
*Report: [./conductor/ASSISTANT_REPORT_v4_28_2_v4_28_3.md](./conductor/ASSISTANT_REPORT_v4_28_2_v4_28_3.md)*

**v4.28.2:**
- ✅ Mise à jour `docs/EMAIL_SETUP.md` pour refléter configuration Proton Mail SMTP
- ✅ Changement domaine `pcap.local` → `pcaplab.com` dans Helm chart et ingress
- ✅ Documentation Kubernetes secrets et configuration Helm

**v4.28.3:**
- ⚠️ **Fix critique:** Ajout dépendances 2FA (`pyotp`, `qrcode`, `Pillow`) manquantes dans `pyproject.toml`
- ✅ Déployé et opérationnel en Kubernetes

**Recommandations:**
- Synchroniser `pyproject.toml` ↔ `requirements-web.txt` (seul pyproject.toml devrait être la source de vérité)
- Ajouter tests CI pour vérifier build Docker
- Tester envoi email en production
